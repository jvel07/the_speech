# the_speech
This project attempts to provide the functionality offered by various libraries used for Speech Recognition in a 'all-in-one' fashion.
Here, libraries like bob.kaldi (python wrapper fot the Kaldi Project), librosa, python_speech_features, cyvlfeat, among others are utilized.

The main purpose of this code is feature extraction. Which can be done easily in a Kaldi's "style". See "recipes" folder.
Features that can be extracted are: mffcs, i-vectors, fisher vectors.
To be added in the future: filter banks, x-vectors.

Readme is going to be updated with more details in the future.
